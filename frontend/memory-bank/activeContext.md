# Frontend Active Context: PowerPoint Translator App

## Current Frontend Development Focus

As of the current development phase, the focus for the frontend is on establishing the core infrastructure and initial components for the PowerPoint Translator App. The frontend implementation is in its early stages, with emphasis on setting up the Next.js 14 project structure, configuring state management with Zustand, and establishing the foundation for PPTX handling with pptxgenjs.

## Recent Frontend Changes

- **Project Structure**: Memory bank established with frontend-specific documentation
- **Architecture Planning**: Component hierarchy and state management approach defined
- **Development Environment**: Planning stage for Next.js 14 app router setup

## Next Frontend Implementation Steps

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up Next.js 14 project with App Router
   - Configure TypeScript with strict mode
   - Set up Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
   - Establish directory structure for components, hooks, and services

2. **Authentication Integration**
   - Implement Supabase authentication
   - Create login/signup forms
   - Set up protected routes
   - Implement share token validation

3. **Core UI Components**
   - Build session dashboard
   - Create PPTX upload wizard
   - Develop slide navigator
   - Implement slide canvas renderer

4. **PPTX Processing**
   - Integrate pptxgenjs for client-side parsing
   - Create metadata extraction utilities
   - Build slide rendering components
   - Develop text chunk identification

5. **State Management Setup**
   - Configure Zustand stores
   - Create session store
   - Set up slide metadata store
   - Establish comment store
   - Implement notification store

## Active Frontend Decisions & Considerations

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design Approach**: Building a library of small, reusable components that can be composed into larger features
- **Client vs. Server Components**: Carefully determining which components should be client-side vs. server-side based on interactivity needs
- **Component Composition**: Using composition patterns to build complex UI from simpler parts

### State Management
- **Zustand Organization**: Splitting global state into domain-specific slices
- **Selective Updates**: Ensuring state updates are targeted and minimal to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Persistence Strategy**: Deciding on which parts of state to persist and how (localStorage, Supabase, etc.)

### PPTX Handling
- **Client-Side Processing**: Evaluating performance implications of client-side PPTX parsing for various file sizes
- **Rendering Strategy**: Determining the best approach for rendering slides (canvas vs. SVG vs. HTML)
- **Text Extraction**: Developing strategies for accurate text run extraction and position mapping

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Loading States**: Implementing skeleton loaders and progress indicators for asynchronous operations
- **Error Handling**: Creating user-friendly error messages and recovery flows
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring basic keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Current Frontend Blockers

1. **PPTX Rendering Complexity**: Determining the most efficient approach for rendering PowerPoint slides while maintaining interactivity
2. **Text Position Mapping**: Ensuring accurate positioning of text overlays for editing
3. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing fidelity with performance for complex slides

## Key Frontend Questions for Next Session

1. What is the maximum expected PPTX file size that needs to be handled client-side?
2. Are there specific PowerPoint features that must be supported in the rendering (tables, SmartArt, etc.)?
3. What level of visual fidelity is required for the slide rendering compared to the original PowerPoint?
4. Should the text editor support rich text formatting or focus on plain text translation?

- **Text Editing**: Not started
- **Commenting System**: Not started
- **Export Functionality**: Not started
